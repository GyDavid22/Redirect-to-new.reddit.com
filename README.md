# What is this?
Reddit changed its web UI in late 2023 and made it available for its users gradually. As of publishing this script there isn't an account setting to revert to the previous UI (you can only switch back to old.reddit.com), but it's still available on new.reddit.com. This script automatically redirects you to the new.reddit.com equivalent if you open a Reddit link, if you aren't there already. However, there isn't any guarantee that Reddit won't shut this solution down.

# How to use?
You need a browser extension which allows you to install and run userscripts, for example [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). If you have one, simply just [click here](https://github.com/GyDavid22/Redirect-to-new.reddit.com/releases/latest/download/reddit.user.js) to install it.
